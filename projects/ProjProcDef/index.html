  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <div id="StdContents">
    Animations of characters with flexible bodies such as jellyfish, snails,
    and, hearts are difficult to design using traditional skeleton-based approaches.
    A standard approach is keyframing, but adjusting the shape of the flexible
    body for each key frame is tedious. In addition, the character cannot dynamically
    adjust its motion to respond to the environment or user input. This paper
    introduces a new procedural deformation framework (Proc- Def) for designing
    and driving animations of such flexible objects. Our approach is to synthesize
    global motions procedurally by integrating local deformations. ProcDef
    provides an efficient design scheme for local deformation patterns; the
    user can control the orientation and magnitude of local deformations as
    well as the propagation of deformation signals by specifying line charts
    and volumetric fields. We also present a fast and robust deformation algorithm
    based on shape-matching dynamics and show some example animations to illustrate
    the feasibility of our framework.
