  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <div id="StdContents">
    Medical volume images contain ambiguous and low-contrast boundaries around
    which existing fully- or semi-automatic segmentation algorithms often cause
    errors. In this paper, we propose a novel system for intuitively and efficiently
    refining medical volume segmentation by modifying multiple curved contours.
    Starting with seg-mentation data obtained using any existing algorithm,
    the user places a three-dimensional curved cross-section and contours of
    the foreground region by drawing a cut stroke, and then modifies the contours
    referring to the cross-section. The modified contours are used as constraints
    for deforming a boundary surface that envelops the foreground region, and
    the region is updated by that deformed boundary. Our surface deformation
    algorithm seamlessly integrates detail-preserving and curvature-diffusing
    methods to keep important detail boundary fea-tures intact while obtaining
    smooth surfaces around unimportant boundary regions. Our system supports
    topo-logical manipulations as well as contour shape modifications. We illustrate
    the feasibility of our system by pro-viding examples of its application
    to the segmentation of bones, muscles, kidneys with blood vessels, and
    bowels.
