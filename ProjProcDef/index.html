<h3>Abstract</h3>

<div class="ProjAbst">
Animations of characters with flexible bodies such as jellyfish, snails,
and, hearts are difficult to design using traditional skeleton-based approaches.
A standard approach is keyframing, but adjusting the shape of the flexible
body for each key frame is tedious. In addition, the character cannot dynamically
adjust its motion to respond to the environment or user input. This paper
introduces a new procedural deformation framework (Proc- Def) for designing
and driving animations of such flexible objects. Our approach is to synthesize
global motions procedurally by integrating local deformations. ProcDef
provides an efficient design scheme for local deformation patterns; the
user can control the orientation and magnitude of local deformations as
well as the propagation of deformation signals by specifying line charts
and volumetric fields. We also present a fast and robust deformation algorithm
based on shape-matching dynamics and show some example animations to illustrate
the feasibility of our framework.
