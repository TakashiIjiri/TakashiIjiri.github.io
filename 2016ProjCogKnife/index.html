<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
In this study, we present “CogKnife”, a knife device which can identify food. For this, 
a small microphone is attached to a knife, which records the cutting sound of food. 
We extract spectrograms from the cutting sounds and use them as feature vectors to train a classifier.
This study used the k-Nearest Neighbor method (k-NN), the support vector machine (SVM)
and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to verify differences of the classification methods. 
To evaluate the accuracy of our technique, we performed classification experiments with six kinds of foods 
(apples, bananas, cabbages, leeks and peppers) in a laboratory environment.
From 20-fold cross validation, we confirmed high recognition accuracies, such as 83% with k-NN, 95% with SVM and 89% with CNN.
